## Steps

To install ORCA, you have to follow these steps respectively.

#### 1. Generate API Key

Register as ORCA Node Operator and log in to [ORCA_WEB_UI](http://orca.chaindeck.io/) and get the API Key to get authenticated for running ORCA.

#### 2. Install Podman

Podman is a containerization tool similar to Docker but focuses on providing a more secure and rootless container environment. Here's how you can install it according to your system preferences.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux (Ubuntu)">
        <Note>The podman package is available in the official repositories for Ubuntu 20.10 and newer.</Note>

        Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.<br />
        Update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:
        ```bash Terminal
        # Ubuntu 20.10 and newer
        sudo apt-get update
        ```
        Install Podman using the following command:
        ```bash Terminal
        # Ubuntu 20.10 and newer
        sudo apt-get install podman -y
        ```

        After the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by checking the Podman version:
        ```bash Terminal
        podman --version
        ```
        Initialize podman machine named `orca` to configure Podman to work with your user account without requiring root privileges. This is called the "rootless" mode, which enhances security:

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine init orca
        ```

        Start podman machine named `orca`

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine start orca
        ```

        Verify the `orca` machine status

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine ls
        ```

        <Warning>If the machine does not start and fails with any error, it means you have to enable virtualization from the BIOS settings.</Warning>
        <Note>Note that the above steps assume that you're using a Ubuntu version (typically versions 20.04 and later). If you're using an older version of Ubuntu, the process might be slightly different.</Note>
    
        After completing these steps, you should have Podman successfully installed on your Ubuntu system. 

        Keep in mind that software and repositories can change over time, so you might want to check the official Podman [documentation](https://podman.io/docs/installation#ubuntu) 
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Mac">
        On Mac, Podman is provided through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once you have set up brew, you can use the ```brew install``` command the install Podman. Use to following command to install:

        ```bash Terminal
        brew install podman
        ```
        You can then verify the installation information using following command:

        ```bash Terminal
        podman --version
        ```

        Next, Create and start your first podman machine named `orca`

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine init orca
        podman machine start orca
        ```

       Verify the machine status

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine ls
        ```

        <br />

        <Note>Podman also provide binaries and pkginstaller in their [GitHub release page](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases)</Note>
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Windows">
        Download and install the latest version of Podman from [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases).

        Initialize podman machine named `orca`

        ```CMD cmd
        podman machine init orca
        ```

        Start podman machine named `orca`

        ```CMD cmd
        podman machine start orca
        ```

        <Note>You can check out the [Podman for Windows guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md) for setup and usage instructions.</Note>

#### 3. Download and install ORCA

You can download ORCA according to your system preferences.

| OS Type           | Architecture Type | Link                                                                                    |

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux(Ubuntu)">
        There are two way that you can use to run ORCA
        ```bash Terminal
        # set environment variable
        export ORCA_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
        # start the orca
        orca

        # you can also pass api-key as argument
        orca -r --API_KEY=<your-api-key>
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Mac">
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Windows">
        Once the download is completed for orca.exe
        To start it, Open the terminal and run below command:
        ```CMD cmd
        start orca.exe -r --API_KEY <your-api-key>

#### 5  . Offboarding ORCA
Whether you're looking to clean up your system or no longer need ORCA, removing ORCA from your system is a straightforward process. The method you use depends on your distribution's package manager. In this guide, we'll cover how to remove packages from Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows.  

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux(Ubuntu)">
        To remove ORCA from your Ubuntu system run the following command:
        ```bash Terminal 
        rm -rf <path-to-orca-binary>
        ```

        Once you removed the ORCA then delete the Podman and its machine(orca)
        Check the machine status:
        ```bash Terminal 
        podman machine ls
        ```

        First, stop the machine:
        ```bash Terminal 
        podman machine stop orca
        ```

        Then, Run following command to delete the existing ORCA podman machine:
        ```bash Terminal 
        podman machine rm orca
        ```
        To uninstall podman, Use the following command:
        ```bash Terminal 
        sudp apt remove podman
        ```
        Verify the uninstallation of the podman and podman machine:
        ```bash Terminal 
        podman machine ls
        podman info
        ```
        In the output of the above command you would not see any machine and information about the podman
