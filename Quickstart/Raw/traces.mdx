Any smart contract execution begins with a transaction initiated by an external account. In turn, the smart contract can interact with other contracts or make transfers. These activities are not recorded in the blockchain. A smart contract, for example, can airdrop tokens (i.e. send free tokens) to a group of users, but this activity is not recorded in the blockchain as a transaction. For such activities, the contract can choose to emit events, which can then be viewed in the logs. Otherwise, the only way to observe them is to monitor the traces.

```bash psql
select * from ethereum.traces where block_number=15000000;
```
