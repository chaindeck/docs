A blockchain receipt (also known as a “light client proof”) provides proof that
some data existed at a specific time, and that the data was approved by the
validators of the blockchain. The receipt contains all the information needed to
prove an individual input was indeed part of an approved block. This paper
proposes a patented method to optimize the way old receipts are verified against
new blocks, by the use of history trees.

```bash psql
select * from ethereum.receipts where number=15000000;
```
