A blockchain receipt (also known as a “light client proof”) provides proof that
some data existed at a specific time, and that the data was approved by the
validators of the blockchain. The receipt contains all the information needed to
prove an individual input was indeed part of an approved block. 

```bash sql
select * from ethereum.receipts where contract_address='0x0013e723f574bafd47cc1542532cdcd98c1c2989';
```
